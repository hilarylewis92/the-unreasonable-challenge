## Reflection

The Unreasonable Challenge was a 3 week long project built during my third module at Turing School of Software and Design. Project goals included using technologies learned up until this point and familiarizing myself with documentation for new features.  

The idea was pitched to me by a friend. He wanted a place that we could use to challenge one another, reflect on challenges, and keep track of completed challenges.  

I chose to use Firebase as my database to store my information so multiple users could sign in and collaborate on different challenges. I used React because I wanted a greater understanding of the framework.

This project was challenging because I had to do a lot of research on UX/UI design in order for the user to understand the application. I decided to implement modals for forms and to view individual challenges. I also implemented masonry to easily layout each challenge and reformat the images to a fixed width.
